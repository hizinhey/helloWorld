# helloWorld
This is the first repositories.

I want to talk something about me. Now, I am a student of HCM University of Science. My major is Information Technology.
Now, i am trying to learn Java and Android. In same time, i think i need to read some document about the other language programming like Dart (Flutter), Javascript (React Native), Python (...), Swift (iOS), and more skill in my major. I hope i can improve myseft to be a Technical Architect. All of this just are my thinking and I will try as possible as i can to catch that.
